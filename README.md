# slim-skeleton-customized
This is a customized version of original slim skeleton (https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton).
In this customized version, I've changed foldering by contexting in respect of DDD.

This is how I normaly use Slim framework, and to make it automized I decided to make it as a ready-to-get project.
